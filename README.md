## String Theory

This lab has nothing to do with physics, I just really like that title. It does have to do with strings though.

## Objective

Make a method that sorts the characters, in *descending* order, in a string by the number of times each character appears in a piece of text. 

## Examples

#### Ex. 1

Say you're given a character list of "r", "a", and "e". You're also given the following text:

> apples and oranges

"R" appears 1 time, "a" appears 3 times, and "e" appears 2 times. Therefore, you would return "aer".

#### Ex. 2

Say you're given a character list of "a", "e", and "s". You're also given the following text:

> Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code 
> will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.

"A" appears 7 times, "e" appears 9 times, and "s" appears 5 times. Therefore, you would return "eas".

## Instructions

This lab is test driven so go ahead and run `rspec` and get those tests to pass! Try not to use `.scan` or `.count` to challenge yourself.
